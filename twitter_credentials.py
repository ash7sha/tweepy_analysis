Variables that contain the user credentials to access Twitter API. From January 2020, the rules of generating access key and consumer key has changed.
To make your API integration more secure, we will no longer show your access token and access token secret beyond the first time that you generate it starting January 20, 2020.
You will be able to regenerate it at anytime here, which will invalidate your current access token and secret. Please save this information if you need to access it.
This does not affect your consumer API keys, which will still be shown here as they are below. To learn more, visit the Forums.
